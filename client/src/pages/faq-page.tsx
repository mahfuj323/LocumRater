  {
    question: "What is Rate My Locum?",
    answer: "Rate My Locum is the UK's first platform where locum healthcare professionals (pharmacists, dispensers, optometrists, and others) can rate and review workplaces and agencies they've worked with. Think of it as TripAdvisor or Glassdoor specifically for healthcare locums â€” giving you insider information before you accept a shift."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a Locum?",
    answer: "A locum (short for 'locum tenens', Latin for 'place holder') is a healthcare professional who temporarily fills in for someone else or covers staffing gaps at clinics, pharmacies, hospitals, or other healthcare facilities. Locums include pharmacists, dispensers, optometrists, dentists, doctors, and other healthcare professionals who work on a temporary or freelance basis."
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I use Rate My Locum?",
    answer: "As a locum, you often have to make quick decisions about where to work, often with limited information. Rate My Locum provides real feedback from other locums about workplaces and agencies, including details about pay rates, transport accessibility, facilities, and general working conditions. This helps you make informed decisions and avoid unpleasant surprises."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I create an account?",
    answer: "Click the 'Sign Up' button in the top right corner of any page. Fill out the registration form with your details, create a password, and you're all set! Registration is free and only takes a minute."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my information kept private?",
    answer: "Yes, your personal information is kept confidential. Only your submitted reviews and ratings will be visible to other users, and you can choose to post anonymously. We never share your contact details with workplaces or agencies."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I submit a review?",
    answer: "After logging in, navigate to the 'Rate' page, search for the workplace or agency you want to review, and fill out the review form with your ratings and comments. Reviews include sections for transport accessibility, payment times, facilities, and more."
  },
  {
    question: "Can employers see who reviewed their workplace?",
    answer: "No, all reviews are kept anonymous from employers to protect locums' identities and ensure honest feedback without fear of repercussions. We believe this anonymity is essential for maintaining the integrity and honesty of reviews."
  },
  {
    question: "What information is included in workplace reviews?",
    answer: "Workplace reviews include ratings and comments on various aspects, including: nearby transport options, pay rates, payment timeliness, special facilities (like parking or break rooms), what locum position was filled, and general comments about the experience."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I search for specific workplace reviews?",
    answer: "Use the search function on our homepage or the dedicated search page. You can search by location, workplace name, or even filter by review ratings to find exactly what you're looking for."
